    "fullText": "Your daily recap at WWDC starts in...\n\nthree... two... one... Go! ♪ \"Better Days (Instrumental)\" by DARKMINDS ♪ We found out how to easily extract document data with the Vision framework.\n\n- So I created a little app in which I can now scan our survey cards.\n\n- And we learned how to design for spatial interaction.\n\nThen app creator Dan Harris, and his book coauthor, Jeff Warren, shared stories and meditation techniques for fidgety skeptics.\n\n- We've been doing a lot of talking about meditation.\n\nI do think it would make sense to just take a quick break and do five minutes! You game for that, Jeff? - Oh, yes I am.\n\n- Oh, and we also learned about the importance of protecting people's privacy online.\n\n- We recognize the importance of providing a more private way to measure ads.\n\n- And a big congratulations to the winners of the Apple Design Awards.\n\nYour apps and games are just...\n\n< Exactly.\n\nTomorrow will be the last day at Dub Dub.\n\nCheck it out.\n\n♪ So many colors! Bye-bye! ♪",
