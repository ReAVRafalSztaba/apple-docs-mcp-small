    "fullText": "♪ Bass-heavy electronic music ♪ Now that I have your attention, here's your day three status report.\n\n♪ We started our training with Lynn exploring new ways to design shortcuts for apps.\n\n- You're well on your way to an amazing App Shortcuts experience.\n\n- Then we discovered how to make desktop-class iPad apps with Mohammed.\n\n- This allows apps to express the layout that's most appropriate to their content, while bringing more functionality to the forefront of the UI.\n\n- Then found out how to take advantage of the latest iOS camera capture features.\n\n- This app has one more trick up its sleeve.\n\nI can tap around and point a spotlight at different objects in the scene.\n\n- We also showed off powerful tools to create cool new layouts and views for apps with SwiftUI.\n\n- SwiftUI provides a rich set of building blocks that you use to compose your app's interface.\n\n- Tomorrow's reports look something like this.\n\n♪ - Go get 'em, tiger.\n\n- That's all for now.\n\nAwait further instructions.\n\n♪",
