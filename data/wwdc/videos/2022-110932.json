    "fullText": "♪ Bass-heavy electronic music ♪ It's time to review day four.\n\nRoll the tape! We checked in with Raj on how you can organize your iPad interface with SwiftUI.\n\n- Better support for state restoration, deep linking, and even richer programmatic control.\n\n- Cool.\n\n- Then Sara showed us how to bring the power of SwiftUI to your UIKit apps.\n\n- You can use the hosting controller anywhere you can use a view controller in UIKit.\n\n- Later on, Brett took us through the latest updates for Vision.\n\n- Here we compute optical flow for a short clip of this dog fetching a water bottle on a beach.\n\n- And we discovered how to create compelling SharePlay experiences.\n\n- Think of SharePlay like a portal, transporting people through their phones and into the same space.\n\n- We also got a lesson in language from Apple's interface writers.\n\n- Writing for interfaces begins with curiosity for who's on the other side of the screen.\n\n- And now for the intel on day five.\n\n♪ Check back in tomorrow for our final report.\n\n♪",
