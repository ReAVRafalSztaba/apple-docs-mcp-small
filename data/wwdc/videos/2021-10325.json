What a ride we’ve had at Dub Dub.\n\nHere’s your recap! ♪ \"Better Days (Instrumental)\" by DARKMINDS ♪ We learned how to create apps for research and care...\n\n- We can provide educational text from the clinicians.\n\n- This cutting-edge research is going to help so many people.\n\n-...And discovered how to design for Safari 15’s tab bar and incorporate visual intelligence.\n\n- Well that's what we've done in Safari 15.\n\n- Beautiful! We also explored how to build Mac apps with SwiftUI...\n\n- These APIs and concepts apply to all platforms.\n\n- ...and said hello to CloudKit Console.\n\n- The next time I launch the console, it will bring me straight to the last container I visited.\n\n- Wow! How is it Friday already? There was just so much: async/await, Xcode Cloud, SharePlay, Metal, Mindful Cooldowns for coding, watchOS, Tiera Fletcher’s amazing talk, Xcode, gaming, accessibility... We hope you had a great week and cannot wait to see what you make this fall.\n\nCiao! ♪",
