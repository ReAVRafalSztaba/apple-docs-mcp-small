    "fullText": "Buckle up! Your day two recap starts now.\n\n♪ \"Better Days (Instrumental)\" by DARKMINDS ♪ We learned how to analyze and classify sounds while sharing a cup of tea with Jon.\n\n- The demo app is using my Mac's built-in microphone to listen to sounds in the environment.\n\n- And discovered how to recognize custom audio with ShazamKit.\n\n- What if you could play a video on your Apple TV and have a companion app that displays questions at exactly the right time? - At lunchtime, aerospace engineer Tiera Fletcher took us to space.\n\n- We are voyagers collecting data beyond our solar system.\n\n- Then we explored Screen Time API with Nolan...\n\n- Homework encourages good habits by restricting a child's access to certain apps.\n\n- ...designed inclusive apps with Cynthia, and learned how to quickly implement in-app subscriptions with StoreKit 2.\n\nWe found out how you can use Nearby Interaction with third-party accessories...\n\n- For example, you can create a nearby peer configuration when you want to start a session between two iPhones that are running your app.\n\n- ...and discovered how to build a simplified sign-on process for tvOS.\n\nNo. Password. Needed.\n\nWhat a packed day! I think I need to go visit the Health & Fitness pavilion and check out today's Mindful Cooldown.\n\nAnd here's a quick preview of what's coming tomorrow.\n\n♪ Pretty cool stuff, eh? See you along the way.\n\n♪",
