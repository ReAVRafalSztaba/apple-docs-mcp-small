Here we go.\n\n♪ \"Better Days (Instrumental)\" by DARKMINDS ♪ We discovered how to bring real-world objects into augmented reality.\n\nAri showed us how to design incredible actions and shortcuts for our apps.\n\n- You open your app up to a world of Shortcuts possibilities.\n\n- While Yusef helped us add some style to our user interfaces.\n\n- This makes the label wrap around to as many lines as needed.\n\n- Check out the new buttons system.\n\nPop-ups, accessible design, and so much more! And hey, speaking of, did you catch Apple engineers and designers as they shared how we built Apple Watch with accessibility in mind? - I mean, we're talking about real sci-fi kind of things right now.\n\n- Amazing! Meanwhile, we explored how to turn people into superheroes with Vision.\n\n- This is cool.\n\n- Can't wait to try that.\n\nWe discovered how to move beyond passwords with iCloud Keychain and Passkeys.\n\n- This is the first step of a multiyear effort in replacing passwords.\n\n- Phew. I'm gonna feel so secure.\n\nAnd we learned how you can create interactive, memorable experiences to onboard people into your app.\n\nAnd there's so much more amazing stuff on the way.\n\n♪  Wow, that was a trip! ♪",
